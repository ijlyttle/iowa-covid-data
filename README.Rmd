# iowa-covid-data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of this repository is to collect Iowa COVID data in one place.

We have a number of sources of data:

- [Iowa COVID site](https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/access)
- [NYT](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
- [Iowa population](https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/counties-estimates)

It would be easiest if the Iowa Department of Public Health could provide this data as CSV files. Perhaps this could serve as a template for what such datasets could look like.
