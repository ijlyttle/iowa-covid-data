The purpose of this repository is to collect Iowa COVID data in one
place.

We have a number of sources of data:

  - Iowa COVID site
  - NYT
  - Iowa population

It would be easiest if the Iowa Department of Public Health could
provide this data as CSV files. Perhaps this could serve as a template
for what such datasets could look like.
